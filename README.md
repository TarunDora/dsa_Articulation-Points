This project is based on Data structures and its applications where we find the articulation points in the graph of the bus routes and stops in bengaluru.
An Articulation point is a vertex in a graph which when removed disconnects the graph into 2 or more separate graphs
So to avoid this we need to resolve them by connecting direct routes between their adjacent vertices.
This project makes use of graph data structure
